# Jacob Nussbaum's Final Python Project

by Jacob Nussbaum for CS 102 Section C Fall 2021

This code (under the name jacob_nussbaum_python_project.ipynb) takes U.S. Covid-19 data provided by the CDC and processes it.

The specific data it is processing is the daily number of new Covid cases on each day from January 2020 until now. This data file is uploaded in the repository under the file name "covidincrease.csv".

The code graphs that data, showing exactly when our numbers started increasingly drastically each day (hitting 300,000 at one point in January 2021!) and when they started increasing by smaller amounts each day (like in the summer of 2021).

Finally, the code displays the average daily increase - or the average value of this graph. 

The .ipynb file seems to cut off the end of the graph, so here is an additional image of the graph:
